            <h3><p>The Hungarian Parliament Building</p></h3>
			<p>The Hungarian Parliament Building
			(Hungarian: Országház [ˈorsaːkhaːz], which translates to "House of the Country" or "House of the Nation"),
			also known as the Parliament of Budapest after its location, is the seat of the National Assembly of Hungary,
			a notable landmark of Hungary, and a popular tourist destination in Budapest.
			It is situated on Kossuth Square in the Pest side of the city, on the eastern bank of the Danube.
			It was designed by Hungarian architect Imre Steindl in neo-Gothic style and opened in 1902.
			It has been the largest building in Hungary since its completion.</p>

            <h3><p>The St Stephen's Basilica in Budapest.</p></h3>
			<p>St. Stephen's Basilica (Hungarian: Szent István-bazilika [sɛnt ˈiʃtvaːn ˈbɒzilikɒ]) is a Roman Catholic basilica in Budapest, Hungary.
			It is named in honour of Stephen, the first King of Hungary (c. 975–1038), whose right hand is housed in the reliquary.
			Since the renaming of the primatial see, it has been the co-cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Esztergom-Budapest.
			Today, it is the third largest church building in present-day Hungary. It is the largest church in Budapest and a World Heritage Site.</p>

            <h3><p>The Hungarian Chain Bridge</p></h3>
			<p>The Széchenyi Chain Bridge (Hungarian: Széchenyi lánchíd [ˈseːt͡ʃeːɲi ˈlaːnt͡shiːd]) is a chain bridge that spans the River
			Danube between Buda and Pest, the western and eastern sides of Budapest, the capital of Hungary.
			Designed by English engineer William Tierney Clark and built by Scottish engineer Adam Clark, it was the first permanent bridge
			across the Danube in Hungary. It was opened in 1849.
			It is anchored on the Pest side of the river to Széchenyi (formerly Roosevelt) Square, adjacent to the Gresham Palace and the Hungarian
			Academy of Sciences, and on the Buda side to Adam Clark Square, near the Zero Kilometre Stone and the lower end of the Castle Hill
			Funicular, leading to Buda Castle.
            The bridge has the name of István Széchenyi, a major supporter of its construction, attached to it, but is most commonly
			known as the "Chain Bridge". At the time of its construction, it was regarded as one of the modern world's engineering wonders.
			Its decorations are made of cast iron.</p>

            <h3><p>Budapest train station.</p></h3>
			<p>Budapest Keleti station (Hungarian: Keleti pályaudvar; "eastern railway station") is the main international and inter-city
			railway terminal in Budapest, Hungary.
			The station stands where Rákóczi Avenue splits to become Kerepesi Avenue and Thököly Avenue.
			Its name in 1891 originates not only from its position as the easternmost of the city's rail termini, but for its original
			role as a terminus of the lines from eastern Hungary including Transylvania, and the Balkans.
			In contrast, the Nyugati (western) railway station used to serve lines toward Vienna and Paris.</p>

		<h2><u>Travels in Rosh Hanikra</u></h2>
			<h4>The Rosh Hanikra cliffs stand majestically on the most northerly point of Israel’s Mediterranean coast
			just meters before the Israel-Lebanese border. The bright blue sea crashes against the white cliffs.
			Light reflects off of the white cliffs onto the seawater creating a beautiful turquoise color.
			The Rosh Hanikra cliffs are riddled with natural grottos that are now accessible to tourists.

			The Rosh Hanikra caves were probably formed when an earthquake caused fissures and crevices in the limestone rock
			through which rain could slowly penetrate.
			Over thousands of years, the rain trickled in through the cracks and waves bombarding the cliffs eroding the chalk and limestone.
			Today there are 200 meters of cavities, tunnels, and chambers that create a labyrinth of caves in the cliffs of Rosh Hanikra.</h4>
